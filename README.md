# Summary
This is a simple boilerplate for a React app.

It doesn't leave a package in the dependencies like create-react-app, and you can very easily customize your webpack config.

# Using the Boilerplate
Simply make a folder for your new app and use `npm init`
```console
foo@bar:~$ mkdir my-cool-new-app
foo@bar:~$ npm init @jase.haddleton/simple-react-app my-cool-new-app
```
