# Summary
This is a simple boilerplate for a React app.

It doesn't leave a package in the dependencies like create-react-app, and you can very easily customize your webpack config.

# Using the Boilerplate
Simply navigate to where you want your new project's folder to be created, and then install and execute the package
```console
foo@bar:~$ cd projects
foo@bar:projects$ npm install --global @jase.haddleton/create-simple-react-app
foo@bar:projects$ create-simple-react-app my-cool-new-app

foo@bar:projects$ cd my-cool-new-app
foo@bar:my-cool-new-app$ npm start
```
